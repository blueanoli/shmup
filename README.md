New little project.
I followed a tutorial and additionally did the following:
-) Enemies only spawn within the canvas
-) Spaceship cannot fly out of the canvas
-) Integrated SFX & music
-) Implemented a high score
-) Enemies spawn randomly
-) You can't continuously shoot when pressing the space key
-) Spaceship stops moving once hit.
The music, SFX, and art are not mine but all from Pixabay. I focused solely on coding.
